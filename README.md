# Welcome to the Advent Of Code

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event that provides daily programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. It's a great way to practice coding, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.

## Repository Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a specific year of the Advent of Code.
- Within each year folder, there are subfolders for each day of the challenge.
- Each day's folder contains my solution to the puzzle for that day, along with any necessary input files and documentation.

## How to Use
- Navigate to the folder for the year you are interested in.
- Open the folder for the specific day to see the puzzle description and my solution.
- Feel free to review, run, and modify the code as you see fit.

## Technologies Used
- The solutions are implemented in Python and Rust.
- Each solution is designed to be efficient and easy to understand.

## Contributions
- This repository is for my personal use, but I welcome feedback and suggestions.
- If you have a different approach to solving a puzzle, feel free to share it with me.

## Contact
- If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me via email or through GitHub.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy coding!
